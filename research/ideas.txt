PRA: it normally reasons over KB graph.
     could we reason over KB graph + semantic/lexical structure of sentences?
	apparently they already did that...

     (could we instead put the graph structure & sentences into a neural net? no
     idea.)

put mentioning sentence + some small neighborhood into RNN to get
	probability of relation

	possibly put X top sentences into RNN to aggregate?

replicate Knowledge Vault atop DBpedia

napriklad neuronky do predpovidani podle vet, misto logisticke regrese

kombinace entity linkage a distant supervision pro slot filling:
	"Barack and Michelle are married." => vygenerovat milion hypotez, ktery Barack a ktera Michelle?

	nesel by udelat nejaky joint learning?
	ze bych na zacatku nevedel, ktery Barack a ktera Michelle, ani ze ta
	veta znamena "jsou v relaci Marriage"
