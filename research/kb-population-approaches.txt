KBP track at 2010 Text Analysis Conference

entity linking + slot filling

sources: newswire, web documents
reference KB is derived from Wikipedia infoboxes

goal of KBP:
	automatically identify salient and novel entities
	link to corresponding KB
	discover attributes

entity linking: mention (name and document) => entity
slot filling: collect info from corpus

reference KB: stotisice entit ze clanku z Oct 2008 dumpu Wikipedie
source collection: 1.3M newswire docs, 500k web documents

entity linking:
	1) query expansion (wiki hyperlink mining; coreference resolution -- "he")
	2) kb node candidate generation (document semantic analysis; information retrieval)
		IR: consider entire background document as query
	3) kb node candidate ranking
		* unsupervised similarity computation (TODO: ?)
		* supervised classification
		* rule-based
		* global graph-based ranking
			^-- optimization
		* information retrieval (IR)
			consider entire background document as query

slot filling:
	hybrid of traditional IE (a fixed set of relations) and QA (responding
	to a query, generating unified response from large collection)

	hybrid system

	query expansion -> information retrieval (document level) ->
		IR, QA (sentence/passage level) ->
		information extraction:
			distant learning / bootstrapping
			patterns, classifiers
		OR: QA; rules ->
		(redundancy removal)

	external databases (YAGO, DBpedia, Freebase, Linked Open Data): as
	background; we want to use news, unstructured web data instead of
	manually constructed KBs
		can use external KBs for bootstrapping, buiding distant learning

	systems benefited from "recursive, global reasoning"
		("is subsidiary of" <--> "is parent of")

	Most of the shortfall in system performance reflects inadequacies in the answer extraction stage,
	reflecting limitations in the current state-of-the-art in information extraction. An analysis of the 2010
	training data shows that cross-sentence coreference and some types of inference are critical to slot fill-
	ing. In only 60.4% of the cases do the entity name and slot fill appear together in the same sentence,
	so a system which processes sentences in isolation is severely limited in its performance. 22.8% of
	the cases require cross-sentence (identity) coreference; 15% require some cross-sentence inference
	and 1.8% require cross-slot inference.

	non-identity coreference: between sentences ("children, son, ...")

	cross-slot inference ("improving story consistency")

	KBP Slot Filling is similar to ACE Relation Extraction, which has been extensively studied for past 7 years
		coreference, cross-sentence inference is more critical
		(ACE RE required having all arguments in 1 sentence)

	While the types of inferences which may be required is open-ended, certain types come up repeatedly, reflecting the types of slots to be filled:
	systems would benefit from specialists which are able to reason about times, locations, family relationships, and employment relationships.
