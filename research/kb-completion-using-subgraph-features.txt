interesting: obtaining negative evidence
	for SFE: find other nodes in same category that are close in
		"personalized page rank" (PPR) -> negative evidence for
		training and testing
		TODO: what's "personalized page rank"?

	(SFE needs both source and target node; PRA selects negative samples on its own)

TODO: "highest-weighted features were almost always -Alias-[some textual relation]-Alias^{-1}-"
	"wrote" / "describes in" / ...

	graph: edges from formal KB mixed with edges from extracted textual relations
	^-- by far the most useful
