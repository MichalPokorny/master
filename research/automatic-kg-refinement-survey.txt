completion methods predict:
	* missing entities
	* missing types for entities
	* missing relations that hold

internal completion methods
	classification: predict type/class of entity given characteristics
	link-based classification; Bayesian classifiers, SVMs, ...

	classification to predict relation between entities: (e1,e2) -> (type of
	relation); tensor neural network to predict relations based on chains of
	other relations

	prob, stats methods: SDType, ProSWIP

	statistical methods to enrich schema with more domains, ranges of
	relations, disjointness, ... by analyzing co-occurence of classes,
	properties [78]

	association rule mining - predict missing types, enrich schema, ...

external completion methods

	type prediction from external data

	predicting missing types from other DBpedia languages (kNN, different kernel fns)

	text-based methods for predicting types and relations
	predicting types: "Hearst patterns", abstracts, entire articles, ...
	predicting relations: usually *distant supervision*
		1) Named Entity Recognition: link to KG
		2) mine for patterns

	IE from semi-structured data (e.g. Wikipedia)
		(entity linkage is mostly free)

	using interlinks

error detection -- internal
	graph-based:
		clustering coefficient, centrality, ...
		mark suspicious links

interesting: rarely paired
	simultaneous completion and error detection:
		simultaneous predictive model creation, creating weights for pieces of information

	rarely trying to complete many things (types, relations, literals, etc.)
