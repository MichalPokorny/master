kubectl create -f corenlp-deployment.yaml
kubectl create -f corenlp-service.yaml
    --> CoreNLP is now available under name 'corenlp-service'

kubectl expose deployment/kubernetes-bootcamp --note=NodePort --port 8080

To push CoreNLP package to Google Container Registry:
	blaze run :push_corenlp_package

When this container push is done, I should reload the CoreNLP service instances.

When they are reloaded, I should check that they now can lemmatize things.
And, ideally, FULLY parse including coreferences.

Actually, DBpedia Spotlight is probably *MORE* important than fully parsing
through CoreNLP.

Once I have both DBpedia Spotlight running and articles split into sentences,
I can start training truthiness classifiers.

I should start Fuseki instances for DBpedia.

Fuseki instances will probably need to download the DBpedia dump to local
disk.
