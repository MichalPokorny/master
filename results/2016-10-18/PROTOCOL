Uses local closed-world assumption.

Extractors:
    Logistic regression over features:
        * bag of words in sentence (word, lemmatized word),
        * window of 2 words to left and right of subject and object
          (subject_window_+2_lemma_go, object_window_-2_word_went, ...)
        * subject_first / object_first
	* POS & NER from subject and object

    Selected features: only those occurring in at least 1 in 10 000 samples

    Trained on 7500 train articles.
    ROC charts generated on 2000 test articles.

Fuser:
    Logistic regression trained over avg(extracted score).

    Trained on 500 calibration articles.
    ROC charts generated on 2000 test articles.
