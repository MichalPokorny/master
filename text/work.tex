\section{First attempt}

We want to replicate Knowledge Vault.
\begin{itemize}
\item Train distant supervision on Wikipedia, Wikidata
\item Prepare training data and evaluation; repeatable, comprehensive
experiments
\item Implement or steal SFE
\item Implement some simple latent model
\item Evaluate and iterate
\end{itemize}
Rough yardstick: \~30\% of >=0.9-confident facts in KV were not present in
Freebase. How close can we get?

\section{Distant supervision on Wikipedia, Wikidata}

\begin{itemize}
\item Download Wikipedia dump, extract plaintext.
\item Named entity recognition: DBpedia Spotlight\cite{dbpedia-spotlight}.

	TODO: How to link DBpedia Spotlight to Wikidata?

\item Coreference resolution etc., NLP: CoreNLP from Stanford\cite{stanford-corenlp}

\item TODO: What about coreference? ("Barack Obama is black. He is the
president of the United States.")
\end{itemize}
